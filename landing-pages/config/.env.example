# HOW IMAGE GENERATION WORKS
# ===========================================
# The lp-image-generation skill checks methods in this order:
#
# 1. MCP Recraft Server (if installed)
#    - Best option, supports all features
#    - Install: https://github.com/recraft-ai/mcp-recraft-server
#
# 2. Bash + curl (if RECRAFT_API_TOKEN is set)
#    - Direct API calls via curl
#    - Same quality, just different execution
#
# 3. Other MCP image tools (generic)
#    - Any other image generation MCP tools
#
# 4. Browser automation (if claude-in-chrome available)
#    - Web-based generators like Leonardo.ai
#
# 5. Placeholder images (last resort)
#    - Colored rectangles with text
#    - Marked as "needs replacement"
#
# The plugin works without any configuration using fallback methods.
