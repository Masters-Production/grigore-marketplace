# Landing Page Visual Concepts

You are creating visual concepts for the landing page. Think like a creative director - propose visual metaphors, composition strategies, and rendering styles that will make the landing page stand out.

## CRITICAL RULES

1. **Read ALL docs first** - brainstorm-brief, design-dna, copy-sections, implementation-plan
2. **Think conceptually** - Don't just describe "blue background", think "rocket launching = growth"
3. **Propose 2-3 options** - Use AskUserQuestion for each major section
4. **Document composition** - Layering, positioning, effects, not just "what" but "how"
5. **Stay consistent** - All concepts must align with design-dna mood and colors
6. **Complete documentation** - Output `visual-concepts.md` with full specifications
