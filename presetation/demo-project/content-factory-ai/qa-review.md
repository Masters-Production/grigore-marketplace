2. **Strong Belief Shifts Per Day** - Each day has a clear FROM→TO shift:

   - Z4: "Automatizarea e pentru programatori" → "n8n e vizual, drag-and-drop"

3. **WHY not HOW Approach** - Scripts focus on WHAT is possible and WHY it matters, not detailed tutorials

4. **Comprehensive CTA Package** - 20+ unique CTAs covering all 5 emotional categories (Fear, Desire, Social Proof, Simplicity, Urgency)

5. **Complete Email Sequence** - 22 emails properly segmented (pre-event, during, post-event, VIP-specific)

6. **Good Engagement Questions** - Questions every 1-2 minutes throughout all scripts

7. **Proper Marathon Structure** - Z1-Z2 free warm-up, Z3 sells Z4 VIP at start + AI Accelerator at end, Z4 VIP as final push

### Issues Found

#### Critical (Must Fix)

*None - all critical requirements met*

#### Warnings (Should Fix)

1. **Personal Story Missing in Z3**
   - Location: `script-day3-4.md:540-562`
   - Issue: Placeholder "[USER - ADAUGĂ AICI POVESTEA PERSONALĂ]" still present
   - Fix: User must add their personal transformation story before presenting

2. **Price Placeholders**
   - Location: Multiple locations in `script-day3-4.md`
   - Issue: "[PREȚ]", "[PREȚ NORMAL]", "[PREȚ MARATON]" not filled in
   - Fix: User must specify actual prices before presenting

3. **Guarantee Not Specified**
   - Location: `script-day3-4.md:832-850`
   - Issue: "[DE SPECIFICAT DE USER]" placeholder present
   - Fix: User must define guarantee terms

4. **Bonus Non-Competition Check**
   - Current bonuses: Skills Pack, n8n Templates, Community, Updates
   - Status: ⚠️ Skills Pack could partially compete with main offer (provides tools to do it alone)
   - Recommendation: Position bonus as "starter" not "complete" - ensure main course offers deeper implementation

#### Suggestions (Nice to Have)

1. **Add Test as Bonus**
   - Per Hristosenko: Tests are best bonus format
   - Suggestion: Create "Test: Cat de pregatit esti pentru AI automation?" with 3 results all leading to webinar topic

2. **More Specific Testimonials**
   - Location: `script-day1-2.md:409-431` (case study Ana)
   - Suggestion: Add 2-3 more specific case studies with measurable results

3. **SMS Templates Enhancement**
   - Only 3 SMS templates provided
   - Suggestion: Add SMS for Z1/Z2 starts and AI Accelerator deadline
