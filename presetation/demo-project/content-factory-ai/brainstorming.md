## Target Audience
- **Temperature:** Mixed (cold to warm)
- **Target Market:** Entrepreneurs, content creators, marketers
- **AI Level:** Intermediate (use AI regularly, want next level)
- **Current State:**
  - Stare at blank screen not knowing what to post
  - Post 3 days then disappear 2 weeks
  - Spend hours daily on content manually
  - Think ChatGPT is all AI can do
- **Desired State:**
  - Content system that runs automatically
  - Posts on all platforms simultaneously
  - Just approve, system executes
  - Recovered time for what matters

## Problem & Solution
- **Main Problem:** Don't know what to post + No consistency + Manual everything
- **Consequences:**
  - Algorithm ignores them (inconsistency)
  - Competitors who automated are visible, they're not
  - 2-3 hours daily on something that can be automated
- **Your Solution:** Claude Code + MCP + n8n system that creates and posts automatically
- **Transformation:** From manual content struggle to automated content factory

## Dark Future (FROM motivation)
> "În 6 luni, dacă continui să faci content manual:
> - Vei fi în continuare pe 2-3 posturi pe săptămână
> - Algoritmul te va ignora pentru că nu ești consistent
> - Concurenții care au automatizat vor fi vizibili, tu nu
> - Vei petrece 2-3 ore zilnic pe ceva ce poate fi automatizat"

## Bright Future (TO motivation)
> "Cu sistemul pe care îl vei vedea:
> - Content non-stop, automatizat
> - Postare pe toate platformele simultan
> - Tu doar validezi și aprobi
> - Timp recuperat pentru ce contează"

## Positioning
- **Your Credibility:** [To be added by user]
- **Big Idea:** Claude Code is the central HUB - one tool controls everything (text, images, video) via MCP, saves to Drive, n8n distributes
- **Key Differentiator:** Not 4 separate tools - ONE instrument that controls everything

## Belief Shifts Required
1. **Z1:** "ChatGPT is all I need" → "Claude Code is an agent, not a chat"
2. **Z2:** "AI makes fake images" → "With right tools, looks professional"
3. **Z3:** "Video is complicated" → "With AI, video without filming"
4. **Z4:** "Automation is for programmers" → "n8n is visual, simple"

## Technical Flow
```
Claude Code + MCP
    ├── Generates TEXT (direct)
    ├── Generates IMAGES (via Nanobanana, Flux)
    ├── Generates VIDEO (via VEO3, Nanobanana)
    └── Saves to Google Drive
            ↓
n8n
    ├── Monitors Drive
    ├── Takes content
    └── Posts automatically to platforms
```

## Tools Used
- **Text:** Claude Code
- **Images:** Nanobanana (realistic), Flux (consistent style) - via MCP
- **Video:** VEO3, Nanobanana - via MCP
- **Automation:** n8n
- **Storage:** Google Drive

## Objections to Address
- "I don't have time to learn new tools" → It's simpler than what you do now
- "AI content looks generic" → With MCP + your context, it sounds like YOU
- "Automation is too technical" → n8n is visual, drag-and-drop
- "I tried ChatGPT, didn't work" → Claude Code is fundamentally different (agent vs chat)

## Bonuses Planned
- **All participants:** Claude Code Skills + Prompts Pack
- **Z4 VIP (19€):** Advanced n8n session + specific bonus

## Course Content (AI Accelerator)
- 12 modules × 3-5h video
