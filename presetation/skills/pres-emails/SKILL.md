# Presentation Emails Skill

## Overview

This skill creates complete email sequences to maximize attendance, engagement, and conversions for sales presentations.

## Input Required

- `brainstorming.md` - Event details, product info
- `script.md` - Key messages and offer details
- Event type (webinar/marathon/workshop)

---

## CRITICAL: Attendance is #1 Priority

**"Доходимость — это один из самых верхних уровней воронки"**
(Attendance is one of the highest levels of the funnel)

- Any change in attendance SCALES massively to all bottom metrics
- Often attendance is 20-25% - potential to DOUBLE it
- Doubling attendance = twice as many people from same ad spend
- Half of all cases where webinars don't convert = problem is attendance, not webinar

---

## Core Principles (From Hristosenko)

### Minimize Unnecessary Contacts (CRITICAL!)
**"Каждое лишнее касание с аудиторией — это минус конверсии"**
(Every extra contact = minus conversion)

- Each email reduces next email open rate
- Only send if value justifies the cost
- Ask: "Is this message REALLY necessary? Does it give enough value to sacrifice next message open rates?"
- Pointless messages: separate "about author" for non-celebrities

### The Ice-Cold Persona
**"Это просто ледяной персонаж. Абсолютно ему плевать"**
(This is an ice-cold persona. They don't care)

For cold traffic, only focus on:
- **Benefit** - What they will see, get, learn, concrete details
- **Gifts** - What they'll receive at the webinar

NO:
- Long stories about you
- Life advice
- Motivational content
- Time management tips

### The Dating Analogy
**"Мальчик нашел девочку на сайте знакомств... 2-3 сообщения достаточно"**
(Like dating - 2-3 messages is enough)

More messages = "too pushy, annoying, nothing better to do"

### Optimal Timing: TOMORROW
**Best option for auto-webinars: START TOMORROW**
- Today they have plans, tomorrow may not
- Creates importance - it's scheduled, has a date
- Interest doesn't fade

**If timing selection needed:**
- Two times: Morning + Evening (e.g., 11am and 7pm)
- Solves timezone problems
- Doesn't scream "it's a recording"

---

## The 30-Day Funnel vs Standard (5-7 Day) Funnel

### Standard Funnel (What Everyone Does):
1. Registration page with form
2. Some emails bringing to webinar
3. Webinar
4. Best case: 3 chase letters

### Khristosenko 30-Day Funnel:
```
Registration -> Email sequence -> WEBINAR 1 -> Chase emails ->
WEBINAR 2 (different topic) -> Content -> WEBINAR 3 (different format) ->
Content -> WEBINAR 4 -> Content -> LAST CALL/Hysteria ->
Demo Access (optional) -> Downsell
```

**Why 30 days:**
- Fresh subscriber: ~50% open emails
- After 30 days: ~5% open emails
- After that, having them = just ballast
- While they open (first 30 days), do EVERYTHING to try to sell

### Rules for Additional Webinars:
1. **DIFFERENT TOPICS** (not same thing repeated)
2. **DIFFERENT FORMATS** (workshop, intensive, practicum, marathon)
3. **AVOID "Analysis Sessions"** (lowest converting - expert absorbed, audience drops)

### "Different Invitations" Principle
**Bad (stuck record):**
- "Let's have dinner" x 100 = spam/unsubscribe

**Good (variety):**
- "Let's have dinner"
- "Let's go to a concert"
- "Let's go ice skating"
- = Higher chance one resonates

---

## Post-Registration Message Structure (5 Messages Optimal)

### DAY 1 (Registration Day):

**Message 1** - "Collect your gift" (immediately)
- "You're registered, collect your registration gift"
- Reload the meanings, bullets - what they'll get, learn, understand
- Frame in terms of THEIR benefits and desires

**Message 2** - Same day
- Continue talking about benefits
- Announce the gift they'll get for coming ON TIME
- That's enough for registration day

### DAY 2 (Webinar Day):

**Message 3** - BIGGEST message (morning)
- Importance of coming
- Special webinar moments worth coming for
- "Link will arrive 1 hour before"
- "No recording" (if true)
- "There will be a prize draw" (if applicable)

**Message 4** - 3 hours before
- Remind 3 hours left
- Link coming to email and messenger
- Can't be late, connect on time
- **Sell the BONUS, not the webinar**
- What the bonus gives, who gets it

**Message 5** - 1 hour before
- Can contain the link
- Short: "We're starting. Subject: Your connection link"

**Message 6** - 15-20 minutes before start
- "Connect, we've started, go, let's go"
- **NEVER send at minute 0, or 5-10 min before** (delivery delays + reaction time)

---

## Chase Messages DURING First 15-20 Minutes

**If attendance still not enough, add chase messages DURING start:**

- Send message with SCREENSHOT of what's happening in room
- "Right now [Expert] is talking about [intriguing topic]. Here's the link, connect, you still have time"
- Pull out most interesting, catchy, useful, or intriguing moments
- 2-3 such messages at start can bring additional people

---

## SMS & Auto-Calls (CRITICAL TOOLS)

### SMS - Main Attendance Tool
**"СМСки дают очень сильный прирост доходимости"** (SMS gives very strong attendance increase)

Why SMS works:
- Email on phone - most don't have notifications
- Telegram - flow of everything, easy to miss
- SMS - rare, notifications and sound definitely trigger

**Optimal approach:**
- ONE SMS, 15-20 min before start
- WITH link to webinar room directly in SMS
- Example: "[Webinar topic]. We're starting in 15 minutes. Your link: [LINK]"

### Auto-Calls
- Much cheaper than SMS
- Record with expert's voice
- **MUST BE SHORT - 15 seconds**
- Talk about bonuses
- Sell topic but don't stretch

---

## Last Call / Hysteria Framework

**Final stage before closing funnel:**

```
"24 hours left and the train leaves, you'll miss X, Y, Z"
"12 hours left, preferential registration ending, with it bonus X burns"
"6 hours left"
"3 hours left"
"1 hour left"
"All burned, doors closed, opportunity left, you're late, welcome to those who joined"
```

**This typically finishes off the funnel with solid orders.**

---

## Demo Access Framework (Optional - For Squeezing More)

- Let people in for small fee (900 rubles) to first week / preparatory block
- Or FREE in exceptional cases

**Critical rules:**
1. MUST have separate chat (not mixed with paying students)
2. Useful lessons WON'T be reason to buy full version
3. Content doesn't sell by itself

**Structure for demo access:**
- First video: Explain what happens in demo, how they'll go through
- Tell about ENTIRE course, results, modules
- End of demo: SELLING video about next steps, modules, results

**Open loops:**
- Give task, answer to which is in main course
- Start topic, resolution of which is in main course

---

## Content Emails Structure (Sell Through Value)

**Structure:**
- Start with BENEFIT headline
- Example: "How removing one product from diet helped lose 12 kg"
- Unpack through usefulness
- End with: "We have the solution. [CTA]"

**NOT:** Direct "12 hours left, everything burns" (save for Last Call stage)
