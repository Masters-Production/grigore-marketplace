## CRITICAL: Bonus Quality Framework

### The Non-Competing Rule
**"Это конкурирует с основным оффером"**
(This competes with the main offer)

If the bonus solves the main problem, people won't buy the product!

**Example of WRONG bonus:**
- Webinar: "How to earn 500k with AI marketing"
- WRONG Bonus: "How to do marketer's daily work in 15 minutes"
- Problem: If they can do the work in 15 min, why buy the course?

### Specific Over General
**"Семь секретов воспитать послушных детей - не очень сильный, он такой общий"**
(Seven secrets to raise obedient children - not very strong, too general)

- General bonuses don't work
- Must be "ядреное" (powerful, specific)
- Hit the BIGGEST fear or desire

**Example:**
- WEAK: "7 secrets to raise obedient children"
- STRONG: "7 proven ways to detach child from gadgets without war"

### Tests as Bonuses (Best Format)
**"Тесты интересны, легкий формат, хочется пройти, хочется получить результат"**
(Tests are interesting, light format, people want to take them, want to get the result)

Works in BOTH soft AND hard niches:
- Soft: Energy, relationships, parenting
- Hard: Sales, marketplace, finance

### The 3 Results Framework
All test results must lead to webinar importance:

**Result 1 - Fragile Stability:**
"Situation is more or less stable, but if you do nothing, it will worsen..."

**Result 2 - Tense Situation:**
"Situation has heated up, warning bells, you need to address this issue..."

**Result 3 - Maximum Urgency:**
"SOS, fire, urgent! Drop everything and fix this immediately..."

**KEY:** No result says "everything is perfect, you don't need anything"

### Bonus for Ads
Adding bonus to ads:
- "А вот [Expert] в шапке профиля выложила тест..."
- Specifies what they'll learn
- Result: Higher clicks, lower cost per subscriber
