## CRITICAL: Offer Presentation Framework

### The Value Formula
**ЦЕННОСТЬ = (Результат x Вероятность) / (Время x Усилия)**
(VALUE = (Result x Probability) / (Time x Effort))

**Goal:** Value must exceed price by 10x in client's mind.

### What People DON'T Pay For
- Number of lessons
- HD quality
- Gigabytes of content
- 58 PDF materials
- 68 spreadsheets and guides

**Mistake:** Loading course with "value" = more bonuses, more modules.
**Result:** "I'll never figure this out, I don't have time for 500 hours of video."

### Pill vs Supplement (BAD)
| Characteristic | Supplement | Pill |
|----------------|------------|------|
| Time | Long (6 months) | Fast |
| Result | Unclear | Obvious |
| Probability | Unknown | High |
| Effort | Required | Minimal |
| Sales | Difficult | Easy |

**Pharmacy stats:** Pills sell 10x more than supplements.

### 4 Levels of Value Depth (MUST USE IN SLIDES)

**Level 1: HAVE (ИМЕТЬ)**
- Before: No skill → After: Has skill
- Before: No income → After: Has income

**Level 2: DO (ДЕЛАТЬ)**
- Before: 2 hours commute on bus
- After: 3 hours work from beautiful cafe

**Level 3: FEEL (ЧУВСТВОВАТЬ)**
- Before: Feeling of helplessness
- After: Feeling of confidence and control

**Level 4: BE (БЫТЬ) - Identity**
- Before: Bad mother / loser / nobody
- After: Supermom / winner / queen

**Use ALL 4 levels** in offer presentation slides!

### Kitchen Examples vs Abstract Phrases
**WRONG (white noise):**
- "Your life will be better"
- "You'll change beyond recognition"

**RIGHT (kitchen examples):**
"Instead of getting to a date on the metro yourself, a Maybach with driver will be sent for you, who'll open the door."

### Average Day Contrast (POWERFUL SLIDE TYPE)
**BEFORE slide:**
"Woke up at 6, breakfast for everyone, makeup, kids screaming, running late, lost temper, cold bus, boss yelled, Lena got promotion for short skirt..."

**AFTER slide:**
"3 hours of work from beautiful cafe, clients write themselves, you choose who to work with..."

### Module Naming (Marketing, Not Methodology)
| WRONG (Methodology) | RIGHT (Marketing) |
|---------------------|-------------------|
| "Introduction" | "Quick Start" |
| "Basics Module" | "First Results in 48h" |
| "Module 3" | "Income On Autopilot" |

Name modules by RESULTS, not by content.

### Bonus Presentation Rule
Each bonus MUST close a specific:
- Pain (боль) - what happened when they tried before
- Doubt (сомнение) - what they fear might happen

**NOT:** Random valuable content
**YES:** "Bonus closing your fear that [specific fear]"
